# How to contribute

üéâü§òüçª First of all, thank you so much for wanting to contribute to this project!

I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition.

## Testing locally

If you've already installed project-explorer globally, you will need to distinguish when you want to test local changes. One way to do so is:

```
node index.js testing
```

I'm using chalk to color the terminal output so if you'd like to console.log changes in a color you can see clearly you can do so like this:

```
console.log(chalk.cyan(`testing!`))
```

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to project-explorer](https://github.com/sdras/project-explorer/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). Always write a clear log message for your commits.

Thanks,
Sarah Drasner
